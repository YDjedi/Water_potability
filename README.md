## Water Potability classification model

- We have used random forest classifier model within accuracy of around 67% to test whether the water is fit for drinking or not based on the cheamical components that are present in the water samples.

- We have used accuracy, precison, recall as well as confusion matrix as classificaion metrics to assess the performance of the model.

- Based on the training of the model we have obtained a 61% precision and 31% recall score.


## Python lbraries used

- *FAST API* : This API tool is used to create a REST API service for our model.

- *Streamlit* : This is frontend based python library for creating webapps in pyhtonic way.

- *Scikit learn (sklearn)* : This is a python library for creating machine learning models and transformational pipelines.

Also some minor but essential libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib are used for data exploration and visualisation.
